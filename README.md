# PySpark ETL Telecom

This [notebook](https://github.com/cvilla87/PySpark-ETL-Telecom/blob/master/PySpark%20ETL%20Telecom.ipynb) uses **PySpark** to load millions of records (around 200 MB of non-compressed files) and process them using **SparkSQL** and **DataFrames**.

The main focus is not the data mining but the data engineering.<br>

Contents covered in this notebook include:
* **Environment configuration**: Jupyter Notebook, UNIX, Python, PySpark and HDFS.
* Management of a Spark Session.
* Load different types of file (**CSV** and **JSON**).
* Data wrangling.
* SQL queries with **SparkSQL**.
* Visualization with **Matplotlib**.
